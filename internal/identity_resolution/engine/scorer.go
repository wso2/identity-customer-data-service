// ScoreCandidate decides how strongly a candidate profile matches the incoming attributes.
//
// The score is not an average. Averaging made a rule's weight depend on how many other
// rules happened to be configured, so adding a rule weakened every existing match, and a
// rule that disagreed pulled a strong match down by exactly as much as a rule with no data
// at all — which meant two sparse profiles scored higher than two well-populated ones.
// Instead one rule is selected to speak for the match and the rest can only object:
//
//  1. Evaluate every rule in its own mode. Rules where either side has no value are
//     Unknown and take no part in what follows.
//  2. Walk the rules in priority order; the first one that agrees becomes the primary
//     signal and its score is the result. Lower-priority rules cannot dilute it.
//  3. A UNIQUE_ID agreeing exactly is conclusive on its own and returns immediately.
//  4. A disagreement on a discriminating attribute (national ID, date of birth) vetoes
//     auto-merge — two present, clearly different values of that kind mean different
//     people, whatever else matches.
//  5. If most of the other applicable rules disagree, the evidence is conflicting enough
//     to want a human, so auto-merge is capped to manual review.
//  6. Auto-merge on a single agreeing rule is allowed only when that rule is the
//     operator's highest-priority one. Any other lone agreement — a shared city, a common
//     given name — is capped to manual review.
//
// Caps only ever downgrade AUTO_MERGE to MANUAL_REVIEW. They never suppress a match
// entirely: the primary signal still stands.
//
// The returned breakdown carries each applicable rule's raw score, keyed by property name.
